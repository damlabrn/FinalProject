- cities: set of cities with haversine coordinates
- distance: the distances between city i to city j where distance[i][j]. 
- toll: the toll prices travelling from city i to city j where toll[i][j].
- numberOfPaths: the number of paths travelling from city i to city j where numberOfPaths[i][j]. 
- fuel: the fuel prices travelling from city i to city j where fuel[i][j]. 
- fuelConsumption: the fuel consumption for travelling from city i to city j where fuelConsumption[i][j]. 
- velocity: the average velocity for travelling from city i to city j where velocity[i][j].
